Python API Homework (HW6) - What's the Weather Like?


Note: You will need to add your own api keys (OpenWeatherMap & Google) to api_keys.py files for each project to be able to run code successfully!
Viewing the Jupyter Notebook files in each project will have a completed example/finished analysis for each!


Background


Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"


Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

### Process
Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator utilizing a simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API  to create a representative model of weather across world cities. Created multiple linear regression plots to visualize the data. \
Also used  jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to woek with weather data to view optimal vaction locations vaed of a set of conditions. This was displayed on gmaps in JupyterNotebook.

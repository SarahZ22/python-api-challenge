Python API Homework (HW6) - What's the Weather Like?


Note: You will need to add your own api keys (OpenWeatherMap & Google) to api_keys.py files for each project to be able to run code successfully!
Viewing the Jupyter Notebook files in each project will have a completed example/finished analysis for each!
